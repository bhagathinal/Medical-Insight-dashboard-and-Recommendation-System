## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare professionals often struggle with analyzing vast amounts of **unstructured medical data**. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to errors.

This project presents an **AI-driven medical insight system** that:
- Extracts key medical insights from symptoms and clinical notes  
- Predicts probable diseases using NLP models  
- Generates personalized lifestyle recommendations  
- Displays results via an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Integrate structured vitals and unstructured clinical notes  
- Perform symptom extraction and disease prediction  
- Build a hybrid AI-based predictive model  
- Provide personalized lifestyle recommendations  
- Deploy the system as a real-time web application
